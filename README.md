# Lab 4

## What Worked Well
I resubmitted my lab 4! This lab was so so helpful for me in understanding redux, I went into it feeling very confused but by the time I wrote the last one of my action functions I felt a lot more comfortable with it. 

## What Didn't
I spent a really long time trying to figure out how to make a new post, and initially tried to create a new post upon clicking the "new post" link, but then realized that that would be unnecessarily roundabout because then I'd also have to have it automatically edit the new post and I couldn't figure out how to get it to work. So I decided to make the new post link just show something that was more like a form that created a new post upon clicking a submit button. A lot of this lab was just trial and error and googling bugs and going to office hours.
