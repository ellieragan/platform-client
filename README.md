# Lab 4
 
I'm planning to use one of my resubmits for this assignment, I'll get it done in the next few days before lab 5 is released.

## What Worked Well
I'm tentatively starting to understand react and redux?

## What Didn't
I'm currently having an issue where clicking on a post overwrites the array of all posts with the one post's ID (so if you click on a post and then click back to the posts page, the posts will all be gone and the screen will be empty), which I just realized is because I'm missing a FETCH_POST action (which should be pretty straightforward to add in), but I know I need to resubmit anyway since I'm still missing a bunch of stuff so I figured it would be better to submit what I have now rather than trying to fix this bug and then ending up submitting late.
